  You can find some help and quick answers to basic questions here, and for more
  information refer to the Provisioner User Guide for more information.
</p>

<p>What is the “OTP” for login?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Instead of a reusable, shareable password, you must use a time-based
    one-time password (OTP) generated by an app such as Authy or Google
    Authenticator. In order to set up the app, you need to obtain a seed value
    from the IT administrator who creates login accounts for Provisioner.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What should I use for an Election Name?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Election Name, dates, etc. are just text strings which the app uses to
    display to the user. “Nov. 2 General Election” would be a typical example.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What are these configuration items, and why no default?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Provisioner User Guide document has details on each. There are no
    defaults, because most of these configurations are specific to a state’s
    election laws.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What’s an Election Definition File (EDF) and where do I get one?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    An EDF is the important dataset created by a voting system’s Election
    Management System (EMS). Among other things, it defines each ballot style in
    the election, and contents of every ballot style, which the app needs in
    order to serve a voter.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m getting an error for an invalid Election Definition File. What next?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The user guide has specifics on the requirements for an EDF, and refers to
    examples that meet the requirements. You’ll need to work with IT staff and
    election data specialists to find and correct the errors in your EDF.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How do I upload the ballots?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ballots are PDF files, and you upload them by creating a ZIP file with all
    the ballots in it, and uploading the ZIP file.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m getting an error for an invalid ballot upload. What next?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The user guide has specifics on the requirements for the ballot ZIP file,
    and refers to examples that meet the requirements. You’ll need to work with
    IT staff and election data specialists to find and correct the errors in
    your ZIP file.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What’s a test voter file and where do I get one?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A test voter file is a dataset that is just like a real voter file, but
    contains fictitious voters. People doing Logic and Accuracy Testing (LAT)
    use these fictitious voters and their real ballots to conduct testing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m getting an error for an invalid test voter file upload. What next?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The user guide has specifics on the requirements for the CSV file format of
    the voter file, and refers to examples that you can use as a model for
    revised voter file in the proper format.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What is test mode and Logic and Accuracy Test?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Logic and Accuracy Testing (LAT) is a pre-election activity in which testers
    use the fictitious voters (defined in a test voter file) and their real
    ballots to conduct testing. The test mode of the Provisioner is the way that
    a Provisioner admin user puts the Provisioner into a special and temporary
    mode of operation, which supports LAT staff using special LAT apps defined
    in more detail in the user guide.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We finished testing. What next?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    After LAT has completed successfully, the Provisioner admin user must first
    exit test mode, and then confirm that testing is complete. After doing so,
    the required next step is providing a production voter file as a
    prerequisite for enabling the Provisioner to serve real voters via a voter’s
    app.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What’s a production voter file and where do I get one?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A production voter file is a file containing voter records exported from a
    voter records database.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I’m getting an error for an invalid production voter file upload. What next?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The user guide has specifics on the requirements for the CSV file format of
    the voter file, and refers to examples that you can use as a model for
    revised voter file in the proper format.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I uploaded the voter file, but there may be some newly registered voters soon,
  who could use the system. What should I do?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    After you’ve successfully uploaded the voter file of real voters from the
    voter registration system, you may upload a supplementary voter file at any
    time, before or after opening the election for service to voters via their
    apps.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What happens when I upload an additional voter file?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If there are new voter records that were not already present in the
    Provisioner data, these new voter records are added.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How do I open and close elections?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Opening an election is done via a screen in the Provisioner UI, including a
    double confirmation to help ensure that opening the Provisioner for full
    service is being performed at the proper time. After opening, closing is
    done similarly, with a double confirmation.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What happens after I open an election?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Each eligible voter can use their app to do a complete session of marking
    their ballot and preparing their affidavit based on data provided to the app
    by the Provisioner.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What happens after I close an election?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Voters’ app will no longer have access to the election via the Provisioner,
    and cannot mark ballots.
  </li>
</ul>
