  MarkIt is a system for outside-the-polling voting by voters using their own
  computing devices, whether phone, tablet, or (next phase) laptop. Voters use
  their own device, download the MarkIt app to their device, and use the app to
  perform absentee voting. The apps use a backend that provides needed services
  and data, such as voter lookup and provisioning the app with ballot data and
  voter affidavit data.

  This Provisioner Web UI exists for Election officials (EOs) to use a web
  interface to perform essential data provisioning functions prior to an
  election. Details of EO activities in provisioning are provided in a User
  Guide document, and online Help/FAQs.
